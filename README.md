# stock-visualiser
Simple Tkinter GUI to present information about a user-selected stock. 

When the program is launched, a welcome window is displayed asking the user to enter a stock ticker. If a valid ticker is entered - e.g 'AAPL', 'TSLA', etc, then a 
new page is opened, displaying a graph of the stock price, with some additional info below.
